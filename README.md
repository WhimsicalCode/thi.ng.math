# thi.ng/math

Common maths functions, macros, bit manipulations and related
utilities for Clojure & Clojurescript.

This library is the result of an projectwide restructuring /
dissolving of the [thi.ng/common](http://thi.ng/common) and
[thi.ng/macromath](http://thi.ng/macromath) libraries.

*Note:* This library relies on the new conditional reader syntax of
 recent Clojure & Clojurescript versions and therefore is **not
 compatible with Clojure versions < 1.7.0**

Please see [index.org](src/index.org) for further information.
